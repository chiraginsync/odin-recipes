    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>This is a delicious vegan Indian recipe where vegetables and chickpeas are served over small potato cakes. It works well as a starter for four, or as a vegetarian and vegan main for two. Place the potato cakes on a plate, serve the chickpeas on top, and don't forget the sauces! Recipes for Indian sauces - coriander sauce and tamarind sauce - are on this site. Finally, sprinkle with some fresh coriander leaves and a few thin slices of fresh onion.</p>

        <li>1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained</li>

    </ul>
    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and peel.</li>
        <li>Place cooked potatoes into a bowl and add cornstarch, ginger, cumin, cayenne, cilantro, salt, and pepper. Mash together with a fork. Oil your hands with a little vegetable oil and divide the potato mixture into 4 equal portions. Pat each portion into a potato patty about 1/3-inch thick.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Fry potato cakes until golden, about 3 minutes on each side. Remove from heat and keep warm.</li>
        <li>Grind peppercorns and cloves with a mortar and pestle.</li>
        <li>Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in red chile peppers, cumin, bay leaves. Add onion, ginger, and garlic. Cook and stir until onion is golden, about 5 minutes. Add pepper-clove mixture, curry powder, and turmeric.</li>
        <li>Mix tomato paste with water. Stir diluted tomato paste and tomato into the skillet. Cook over medium heat until the tomato has softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in chickpeas and simmer over low heat for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Spoon chickpea sauce over the potato cakes and sprinkle with cilantro leaves.</li>
    </ol>
